We designed a system for air pollution sensor in the enterprise/household buildings.

A Course Search Engine based on semantic meanings of query words.

Final Project for *Digital Speech Recognition 2019 Spring*.

- Developed a context-aware search engine with BERT to find semantic related results instead of matching word by word.
- Implemented a PRF algorithm to optimize searching results.
