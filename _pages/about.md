I'm currently a student at National Taiwan University, Department of Electrical Engineering. I am currently in my final year and have a strong passion for artificial intelligence.

My research interest includes Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Embeddings, especially incorporating features from different modalities. To be more precisely, I find Multimodal Learning very intriguing. 

I've been thinking about how technology can improve people's welfare, and I've been working on several projects on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Data Analysis. Some are research-oriented, while some are application-oriented, but all of them are linked to solving issues which I've witnessed in my life experience.
