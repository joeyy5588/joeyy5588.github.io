I'm currently a first year PhD student at UCLA, advised by Prof. Kai-Wei Chang. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to equip computers with the ability to understand and relate data across different modalities. Specifically, I am interested in the following topcis:

- **Representation Learning for Decision Making**: *Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN)*, *Robotic Manipulation*, *Generative Models for planning*
- **Learning reasoning via Interaction**: *Learning VL representations via embodied interactions*, *Learning relation-aware VL representations from video*
- **Compositionality skills for multimodal generation and reasoning**: *Open-World Image/Video Captioning*, *Language-Conditioned Image Manipulation*

I'm looking for Research Intern opportunities for 2024 Summer.
