I'm currently a research assistant at Vision and Learning Lab at National Taiwan University, Department of Electrical Engineering. 

My research interest lies in the intersection of Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), aiming to equip computers with the ability to understand and relate data across different modalities. At the heart of my research effort is the technical challenge of deploying multimodal machine learning to real-world applications, where annotated data is scarce and often perceived in various modalities. To achieve this, I have been committed to studying unsupervised and semi-supervised multimodal generation, grounding, and reasoning.
